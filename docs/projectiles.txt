Client is rendering ~100ms behind the server and ping is ~50
Bullet travels 1 every 50ms


Without any ffwding

Real
Time (ms)	Client		ClientBulletPos		Server			ServerBulletPos		OtherClient			OtherClientBulletPos
0			Client fires0					n/a
50						1					rcvs msg		0
100						2									1					Rcvs msg			0
150						3									2										1
200						4									3										0

This is almost fine, as the "other client" is rendering 100ms behind reality anyway, so it appears at the right time.
But the server needs to check for collisions on behalf of the shooting client

--------------------------------------------------

With ffwding:

Real
Time (ms)	Client		ClientBulletPos		Server			ServerBulletPos		OtherClient			OtherClientBulletPos
0			Client fires0					n/a
50						1					rcvs msg/FFWD!	0/3
100						2									4					Rcvs msg			0
150						3									5					Starts rendering	1
200						4									6										0

Here, the server ffwds the projectile by 100ms+50ms so it is ahead of the shooting client
It then sends a "fired" message to the other clients
