TODO
Client should not pause when losing focus
Esc not working in client
Client should calc positions of entites based on lerp of previous positions and current time
Avatar falling through floor


CLIENT
Send inputs every 50ms
Render others from history - 50ms ago, lerp between historical positions


SERVER
Receive player inputs and pass the to avatar (if later than prev)
Run game loop every 15ms
	Send entity positions for changed entities


PLAYER CONTROL
Turning is handled entirely by the client
Player moves and their avatar is moved immediately
	Client sends input to server
	Server calcs position of the client
	Server sends back position of all entities
	Client corrects itself based on servers position
Player shooting
	Client sends shot msg with timestamp and direction
	Server moves players to correct position and checks the client has hit
	 
	
LATER
Simulate slow network
Split up into separate projects: Client, server, shared, Sorcerers
Reduce object creation
Kick players who don't move
Confirm a client is a proper client
