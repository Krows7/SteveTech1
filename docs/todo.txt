Adjust clients position in the direction of the "correct" position, but only by a small bit
	Dont override errorlistemer
	Delay sending msgs in thread
	Client's avatar position going haywire
Unit test position client avatar based on history and client position history
Search for todos
	Client jumping back since we're comparing what the server sent 100ms ago
Reduce dependencies between classes
Treat bullets like players avatar
Test with 2 players and see if I can see the other avatar
Create server-controlled moving item to check interpol
Shooting
Delib slow down messages
Make all objects kinematic on client side?
Move entities to shared package


UNIT TESTS / INTEGRATION TESTS
Test interpolation


CLIENT
Send inputs every "server tickrate"
Render others from history - 50ms ago, lerp between historical positions


SERVER
Receive player inputs and pass the to avatar (if later than prev)
Run game loop every 20ms
	Send entity positions for changed entities


PLAYER CONTROL
Turning is handled entirely by the client
Player moves and their avatar is moved immediately
	Client sends input to server
	Server calcs position of the client
	Server sends back position of all entities
	Client corrects itself based on servers position
Player shooting
	Client sends shot msg with timestamp and direction
	Server moves players to correct position and checks the client has hit
	 
	
LATER
Don't send entity update if position not changed
Simulate slow network
Split up into separate projects: AbstractClient, Abstractserver, shared, Sorcerers
Reduce object creation
Kick players who don't move
Close client if server crashes
Use tpf to ensure clients/server run at same speed
Stop client if no comms for a while
