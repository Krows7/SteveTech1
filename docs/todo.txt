URGENT
Can't seem to shoot movingentity correctly
	Log position of player when shooting, on both client and server
	Log position of moving target on client and server at the point it is hit
	Add walls along edge to aid shooting tests
	Client should remove its own debugging spheres
	Create test ECS system
Move entity functionality to systems - ECS!
	Adjust grenades in the same way that avatars are adjusted
Why does player slow down when falling?
Search for todos
Show game state on hud


TODO
Should not have a generic "process()" method?
Grenades
Check game status changes when player joins
Use new models
Make floor a single quad
Less damage from hitscan over distance
Laser bullets
Origin of entities should be floor 
Only rotate entities left/right
IsOnGround not always correct
Create sep projects for test game, killer crates
	Game settings: num players per side, max sides
Show current game time
Separate into AbstractEntityServer, AbstractGameServer, TestGameServer
Use latest JME libs
Create game lobby
Walking up steps
Physics test - do explosion
Confirm source timings
Draw map
Am I adjusting rotation?
Server don't check for hit unless client thinks it has hit
Use test annotations
Add lots of comments
Unit test rewind avatars
Spectator mode
	Send ability updates to client, to confirm ammo etc...
Show where players are according to server (in realtime)
Create generic classes and test them
Reduce dependencies between classes
Make vars private/protected


LATER
Simple physics - pushing
Player reconnect and get same avatar
Show kryonet logging
Kryonet test - send lots of other random msgs
Reduce object creation, including calls to clone()
Don't use broadcast()?s
Kick players who don't move
Use tpf to ensure clients/server run at same speed
Stop client if no comms for a while
client/server encryption
Make classes final
Physics - pushing
Test with cheating client
User enter name and ip address
Only send entity messages to players that have joined the game
