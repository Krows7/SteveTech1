URGENT
Change networking code
Try and run server as stand-alone
Grenades
Option to turn off client sync
	Create TestGamePlayersAvatar
	When shooting, player is moving
	Hitscan weapons
Crates not dropping until knocked
Player not dropping by grav after warp until movement received - test using SimpleFPS?


TODO
Confirm source timings
	Warp player if position > 3?
	Client statuses - connected, in game
Don't use broadcast()
Draw map
Show error if client unable to connect
	Avatar falling slowly when not moving forwards (just like jetpac?)
Laser bullets
Add more walls
Make server & client abstract
force avatar warp test
Search for todos
Todo - am I adjusting rotation?
Server don't check for hit unless client thinks it has hit
Use test annotations
Add lots of comments
Unit test rewind avatars
Spectator mode
Create game lobby
Send ability updates to client, to confirm ammo etc...
Show where players are according to server (in realtime)
Create server-controlled moving item to check interpol
Create generic classes and test them
Reduce dependencies between classes


LATER
Split up into separate packages: AbstractClient, Abstractserver, shared, Sorcerers
Reduce object creation, including calls to clone()
Kick players who don't move
Use tpf to ensure clients/server run at same speed
Stop client if no comms for a while
client/server encryption
Make classes final
Test with cheating client
User enter name and ip address


CLIENT
Send inputs every "server tickrate"
Render others from history - 100ms ago, lerp between historical positions


SERVER
Receive player inputs and pass the to avatar (if later than prev)
Run game loop every 20ms
	Send entity positions for changed entities


PLAYER CONTROL
Turning is handled entirely by the client
Player moves and their avatar is moved immediately
	Client sends input to server
	Server calcs position of the client
	Server sends back position of all entities
	Client corrects itself based on servers position
Player shooting
	Client sends shot msg with timestamp and direction
	Server moves players to correct position and checks the client has hit
