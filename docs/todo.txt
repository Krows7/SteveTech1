TODO
Less damage from hitscan over distance
Make floor a single quad - needs rotating
Strict mode - check if position already exists in positioncalc!
Simulate client?
Tell player they have died - hide entity
Lobby queue players
Games - "powered by SteveTech"
Animate messages?
Add Features to readme
Check code compiles without any game-specific code
Kryonet encryption?
Move messagereceiver to another class
Should not have a generic "process()" or preprocess() method?
Use new models
Laser bullets
	Origin of entities should be floor 
Only rotate entities left/right
IsOnGround not always correct
Create sep projects for test game, killer crates
	Game settings: num players per side, max sides
Use latest JME libs
Create game lobby
Walking up steps
Physics test - do explosion
Confirm source timings
Draw map
Am I adjusting rotation?
Server don't check for hit unless client thinks it has hit
Use test annotations
Add lots of comments
Unit test rewind avatars
Spectator mode
Create generic classes and test them
Reduce dependencies between classes
Make vars private/protected
Test with cheating client


LATER
Simple physics - pushing
Show kryonet logging
Reduce object creation, including calls to clone()
Don't use broadcast()?s
Kick players who don't move
Use tpf to ensure clients/server run at same speed
Stop client if no comms for a while
client/server encryption
Make classes final
User enter name and ip address
Only send entity messages to players that have joined the game
