I'm currently developing an open-source multiplayer networked FPS engine, after getting addicted to Overwatch and TF2 and then wondering why there's not a single open-source Java multiplayer source game anywhere.  I aim to fix that, and at the moment progress is coming along nicely; it was never going to be easy but so far it has remained fun.  There's nothing to actually release yet; I'm going to wait until I've actually got a full game working before I release the source.

Anyhoo, the project has necesitated some additional code not directly linked to the project, which I can release.  The first one is a Simple Physics Library for jMonkeyEngine.

jMonkeyEngine comes with an excellent physics engine.  However, it is almost too excellent, and has a lot of features that I don't require, that take up CPU usage.  In addition, a multiplayer networked FPS requires the ability to "rewind" time on objects, which the existing JME physics engine can't do.

The full source is available here, which includes an example FPS.

And here is a video showing it in action.

Animate - send with update pos mail?

URGENT
Look for soldiers for Moonbase Assault
Blog post simple physics
	Animate players avatars
JME GUI
Show current game time
Jumping is a bit high on client, not server
	Client countdown game time itself
	Adjust grenades in the same way that avatars are adjusted

TODO
Roaming zombie - stop randomly
Game lobby
Console to connect to lobby
Origin of entities should be floor 
Grenades
Check for packet loss
Less damage from hitscan over distance
Make floor a single quad - needs rotating
Strict mode - check if position already exists in positioncalc!
Simulate client?
Tell player they have died
Lobby queue players
Games - "powered by SteveTech"
Add Features to readme
Should not have a generic "process()" or preprocess() method?
Laser bullets
IsOnGround not always correct
Create sep projects for test game, killer crates
Use latest JME libs
Walking up steps
Physics test - do explosion
Server don't check for hit unless client thinks it has hit
Use test annotations
Add lots of comments
Unit test rewind avatars
Spectator mode
Create generic classes and test them
Make vars private/protected
Test with cheating client
Reduce object creation, including calls to clone()
Kryonet encryption?
User enter name
Use gradle for libraries


LATER
Check code compiles without any game-specific code
Simple physics - pushing
Don't use broadcast()?s
Kick players who don't move
Use tpf to ensure clients/server run at same speed
Stop client if no comms for a while
Make classes final
Only send entity messages to players that have joined the game
