TODO
	NOT NEEDED: Send msg to client asking for time, and get time sent.  When rcvd, calc clients time
Client should calc positions of entites based on lerp of previous positions and current time
	Avatar falling through floor



LATER
Split up into separate projects: Client, server, shared, Sorcerers
Reduce object creation
Kick players who don't move
Confirm a client is a proper client
