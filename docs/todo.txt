CLIENT

SERVER
Receive player inputs and pass the to avatar (if later than prev)
Run game loop every 20ms
	Send entity positions for changed entities


PLAYER CONTROL
Turning is handled entirely by the client
Player moves and their avatar is moved immediately
	Client sends input to server
	Server calcs position of the client
	Server sends back position of all entities
	Client corrects itself based on servers position
Player shooting
	Client sends shot msg with timestamp and direction
	Server moves players to correct position and checks the client has hit
	 
	
LATER
Don't send entity update if position not changed
Split up into separate packages: AbstractClient, Abstractserver, shared, Sorcerers
Reduce object creation, including calls to clone()
Kick players who don't move
Use tpf to ensure clients/server run at same speed
Stop client if no comms for a while

Make classes final
