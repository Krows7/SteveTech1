URGENT
Test two clients, can one see the other shooting?
	Are grenades actually syncd?
Check client and server times are the same
	Don't adjust client until there's enough data
	Why can client move if server avatar can't move?  And why does it rotate around correct position?
	Player sometimes starting on edge
Improve border - server side is just a box, client side is an invisible box with hills around
Player dies - show died model.  Manual IAnimation?
	Not rotating hills
	Player dies - restart, stop client moving
	Rotate snow hills
Show current game time - a bit big
Add open-source msg to the top of all files

Add Features to readme
Should not have a generic "process()" or preprocess() method?
Walking up steps
Physics test - do explosion
Server don't check for hit unless client thinks it has hit
Add lots of comments
