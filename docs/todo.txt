Laser bullets
Create sep projects for test game, killer crates
Use latest JME libs
Walking up steps - have flag to force player to rise
Physics test - do explosion
Server don't check for hit unless client thinks it has hit

Spectator mode
Create generic classes and test them
Make vars private/protected
Test with cheating client
Reduce object creation, including calls to clone()
Kryonet encryption?
User enter name
