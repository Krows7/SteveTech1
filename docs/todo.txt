URGENT
	HUD text not in correct place
Client countdown game time itself
Store collisions and process at end
Move messagereceiver to another class
	HUD text not in correct place
Moving target origin is 0.5
Check game status changes when player joins
Can't seem to shoot movingentity correctly
	Adjust grenades in the same way that avatars are adjusted
	Why does player slow down when falling?

TODO
Move entity functionality to systems - ECS?

Grenades
Use new models
Make floor a single quad
Less damage from hitscan over distance
Laser bullets
Origin of entities should be floor 
Only rotate entities left/right
IsOnGround not always correct
Create sep projects for test game, killer crates
	Game settings: num players per side, max sides
Show current game time
Separate into AbstractEntityServer, AbstractGameServer, TestGameServer
Use latest JME libs
Create game lobby
Walking up steps
Physics test - do explosion
Confirm source timings
Draw map
Am I adjusting rotation?
Server don't check for hit unless client thinks it has hit
Use test annotations
Add lots of comments
Unit test rewind avatars
Spectator mode
	Send ability updates to client, to confirm ammo etc...
Show where players are according to server (in realtime)
Create generic classes and test them
Reduce dependencies between classes
Make vars private/protected
Test with cheating client


LATER
Simple physics - pushing
Show kryonet logging
Reduce object creation, including calls to clone()
Don't use broadcast()?s
Kick players who don't move
Use tpf to ensure clients/server run at same speed
Stop client if no comms for a while
client/server encryption
Make classes final
User enter name and ip address
Only send entity messages to players that have joined the game
