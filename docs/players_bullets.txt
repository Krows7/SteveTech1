Owned by a gun and a player.
Fired by a client, that client (and every other client and the server) has control over its own position, movement and removal, although only the server calculates damaged.  No updates are sent by the server for it.  This has the advantage of speeding everything thing up and reducing update messages



Process:-
* When an avatar is created with a gun, each player is also sent a certain number of "unfired" bullets.
* When a player shoots a bullet, they launch the entity and have full control over its path.  
* The server knows the player has fired since it receives the same inputs
* When the server receives the "fired" command, it fires its own projectile, and fast-forwards its position to where it should be in order for the server to be ahead of the shooting client, as per all other entities.
* The server sends a message to all the clients saying that a bullet has been fired.  (The firing client ignores this message).
* The other clients then launch their own projectiles, and are again responsible for its position, movement and removal.  No updates are sent by the server for it.
