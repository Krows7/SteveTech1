Notes: Can't update completely accurately since they will keep overshooting!


Client render in past to ensure it has enough data.
This example assumes a 50ms delay in comms from client to server (and vice versa)
Client and server positions should match if client time is earlier

TIME	CLIENT						Server
0		Client presses down(1)
Pos:	0,1							0,0

50		Client presses down(2)		Server rcvs "Client presses down(1)"
Pos:	0,2							0,1

100		Client stops pressing		Server rcvs "Client presses down(2)"
Pos:	0,2							0,2

150
Pos:

200		Client presses shoot
Pos:	Bullet 0,0

250:								Server receives shoot
Pos:	Bullet 0,1					Bullet 0,0

300: 
Pos:	Bullet 0,2					Bullet 0,1
