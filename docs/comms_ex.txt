Client render in past to ensure it has enough data.
This example assumes a 50ms delay in comms from client to server (or vice versa)
Client and server positions should match if client time is earlier

TIME	CLIENT						Server
0		Client presses down(1)
Pos:	0,1							0,0

50		Client presses down(2)		Server rcvs "Client presses down(1)"
Pos:	0,2							0,1

100		Client stops pressing		Server rcvs "Client presses down(2)"
Pos:	0,2							0,2
