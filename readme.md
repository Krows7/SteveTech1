# SteveTech1

Complete open source multiplayer FPS Engine for Java

Designed and Developed by Stephen Carlyle-Smith (stephen.carlylesmith@googlemail.com)


SteveTech1 is a 3D multiplayer FPS framework and engine, designed to help you create games such as Team Fortress 2, Overwatch, PUBG etc.. in Java.  It includes almost all the code you'll need to create your own multiplayer FPS, and uses JMonkeyEngine for the 3D.  It is designed to be easily modifiable and extendable (as the example games will show).  It is intended to be the Java equivalent of something like the Source engine.  You will need to provide your own assets of course.



### FEATURES:
* Client prediction & lag-compensation
* TCP and UDP for networking
* Collision detection & simple physics
* Projectile and hitscan weapons


### GAMES MADE WITH STEVETECH1
This project comes with a fully working exampke game "Undercover Agent".  I'm currently working on two others games (as of the time of writing):

* Moonbase Assault (https://bitbucket.org/SteveSmith16384/moonbaseassault/src/master/)
* Two Weeks in the Pub (Fortnite clone) (https://bitbucket.org/SteveSmith16384/twoweeksinthepub/src/master/)

Here's a video of Moonbase Assault:-
