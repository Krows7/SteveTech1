# Undercover Agent

A simple multiplayer FPS to demonstrate the use of SteveTech1.


## Overview
Each player controls an identical avatar (which is a snowman at the time of writing).  There are also quite a few other identical snowmen littered around.  Each player must identify another player and shoot them with a snowball.

Here's a video showing the game:-
